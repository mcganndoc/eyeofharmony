The Eye of Harmony, which balances all things, that they may neither flux nor wither nor change their state in any measure.

I start as I mean to go on--Always. I may not accomplish everything right away, but when I do, it is done right. And that is the right thing to do.

“You don’t just give up. You don’t just let things happen. You make a stand! You say no! You have the guts to do what’s right, even when everyone else just runs away.”
